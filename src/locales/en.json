    "title": "Redefining Emergency Cardiac Diagnostics",
    "subtitle": "In the race against time, precision and speed are everything. K-MARA introduces a game-changing solution for risk stratification of chest pain patients.",
    "text": "Our rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is not just a tool; it's a strategic ally in the emergency room. By simultaneously measuring two crucial cardiac biomarkers, Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) and Troponin I (cTnl), we offer clinicians a clear, early view of a patient's risk of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) within the next 30 days. This allows for faster, more informed decision-making, optimizing hospital resources and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes."
